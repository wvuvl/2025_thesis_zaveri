Efficient visual trackers overfit to their training distributions and lack generalization abilities, resulting in them performing well on their respective in-distribution (ID) test sets and not as well on out-of-distribution (OOD) sequences, imposing limitations to their deployment in-the-wild under constrained resources. We introduce SiamABC, a highly efficient Siamese tracker that significantly improves tracking performance, even on OOD sequences. SiamABC takes advantage of new architectural designs in the way it bridges the dynamic variability of the target, and of new losses for training. Also, it directly addresses OOD tracking generalization by including a fast backward-free dynamic test-time adaptation method that continuously adapts the model according to the dynamic visual changes of the target. Our extensive experiments suggest that SiamABC shows remarkable performance gains in OOD sets while maintaining accurate performance on the ID benchmarks. SiamABC outperforms MixFormerV2-S by 7.6\% on the OOD AVisT benchmark while being 3x faster (100 FPS) on a CPU. We also contribute by making the codebase publicly available at \url{https://wvuvl.github.io/SiamABC/}.

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Gianfranco Doretto, for his unwavering support throughout my journey as both an undergraduate and a master's student in his lab. During my time there, I developed a foundational understanding of what it means to be a scientist—not only in terms of thinking like one but also in the pursuit of profound and meaningful questions and making impactful contributions. Under his guidance, I gained extensive knowledge in computer vision, machine learning, and neuroscience. Additionally, I had the opportunity to present many of my projects at various prestigious conferences and, more importantly, to establish valuable connections. From a career perspective, this experience allowed me to expand my network with individuals I had only aspired to meet. None of this would have been possible without his support. \\

I would like to express my sincere appreciation to my lab mates: Shivang Patel, Zaigham Randhawa, Dr. Ranya Almohsen, Dr. Marcela Mera, Quinn Jones, Dr. Sinan Sabri, and Samuel Chambers. Our engaging discussions, critical feedback, guidance, motivation, encouragement, and, of course, the lighthearted jokes have been invaluable in alleviating the stress of paper submissions. \\

I also want to extend my thanks to Matthew Keaton, whom I consider not only a close friend but also a mentor. His guidance has allowed me to rapidly acquire knowledge, and he has patiently addressed my many questions and comments. I eagerly look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with him again in the future.\\

I would like to express my gratitude to my partner, Paola Perez-Vega, who provided me with comfort during stressful times and always had the right words to say when I needed them most. With her support, I was able to consistently motivate myself and persevere through challenging moments, both personally and professionally. \\

I would also like to extend my thanks to my close friends Foster Holmquist, Juan Galindo, and Lucas Root. Our endless discussions and debates on various scientific topics have helped me maintain an open mind and continue my growth as a scientist. \\

Additionally, I want to acknowledge my Dad, Mom, and Sister for their support in helping me grow as the youngest member of our family, always encouraging me to do my best. Lastly, I would like to express my appreciation to the Root family for providing me a home away from home.\\
